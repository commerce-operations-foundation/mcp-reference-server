/**
 * Log Sanitizer - Redacts sensitive data from logs and provides data validation
 *
 * This utility is designed for:
 * 1. Redacting sensitive information from log output (passwords, tokens, etc.)
 * 2. Providing format validation helpers for data quality
 *
 * Note: This MCP reference implementation does NOT perform input sanitization
 * for SQL injection, XSS, etc. because:
 * - MCP servers communicate with Fulfillment APIs, not databases
 * - The Fulfillment backend is responsible for its own input validation
 * - Order data requires legitimate PII and special characters
 * - Removing SQL keywords would break legitimate customer names/addresses
